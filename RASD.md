## INTRODUCTION

### Purpose: here we include the goals of the project

- G1: SafeStreets must allow users to send pictures of violations, including their date, time and position. <!--TODO specify "send"-->
- G2: Users must be allowed to access to anonymous and aggregated data.
- G3: Authorities must be allowed to access to all the data without restrictions.
- G4: When available, data provided from municipalities must be integrated in SafeStreets.
- G5: SafeStreets must suggest possible interventions according to data that have been collected.
- G6: SafeStreets must be able to generate traffic tickets using MFS.
- G7: Data provided to generate fines must be checked in order to guarantee their reliability.
- G8: Safestreets must provide statistics on collected data.

### Scope: here we include an analysis of the world and of the shared phenomena 
### Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
- MFS: municipality's service to generate fines <!--TODO-->
