\subsection{Purpose}

\textbf{SafeStreets} is a crowd-sourced application that intends to
provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic
violations occur. The main target of the application are violations that
can be easily captured by a camera (like, for instance, parking
violations). SafeStreets intends also to provide users with the
possibility to mine the stored information with different levels of
visibility. Moreover, the application must cross the collected data with
information coming from the municipality to provide suggestions on
possible interventions to decrease the incidence of violations and
accidents. In the end, the application must forward data about
violations to generate traffic tickets, and must allow authorities to
get statistics on issued tickets.
\medskip\\
These requirements are exploited by developing several services:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{SafeReports} allows common users to send violation reports.
\item
  \textbf{SafeAnalytics} allows common users and authorities to mine
  stored information.
\item
  \textbf{SafeTickets} allows authorities to get statistics on issued
  tickets.
\item
  \textbf{SafeSuggestions} allows municipality users to get suggestions
  on possible interventions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goals}

The purpose of the software is captured by the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{G1} SafeReports must allow common users to send violation
  reports.
\item
  \textbf{G2} SafeAnalytics must allow common users to get anonymous
  data on violations.
\item
  \textbf{G3} SafeAnalytics must allow authorities to access to all the
  data without restrictions.
\item
  \textbf{G4} SafeSuggestions must allow municipality users to get
  suggestions on possible interventions.
\item
  \textbf{G5} SafeStreets must generate traffic tickets forwarding
  reliable data to MTS.
\item
  \textbf{G6} SafeTickets must allow authorities to get statistics on
  issued tickets.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}

SafeStreets must interface with different types of users and information
sources. In this context, it is very important to identify the placement
of SafeStreets and its services with the entities of the scenario. To do
so, we will refer to the following picture. Afterward, every link
between SafeStreets and the entities will be deeply analyzed to
exhaustively describe the shared phenomena of the scenario.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Relationship diagram}
\end{figure}

Two types of interactions can be defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Interactions through services} (blue arrows in the diagram)
\item
  \textbf{Interactions with resources} (red arrows in the diagram)
\end{itemize}

The main difference between the interactions is the role of SafeStreets.
In the interactions through services, SafeStreets has a
passive role, in the sense that the activation of the interaction is
triggered by a request coming from the user through one of the offered
services. In the interactions with resources, SafeStreets has an active
role, in the sense that the activation of the interaction is
automatically triggered by SafeStreets application to exploit back-end
processes.
\medskip\\
Services are exploited differently depending on the type of user that is
enjoying the application. The type of the user is determined in the
registration phase, which is different depending on this choice.
Everyone can sign up as a common user. Instead, to sign up as an
authority or municipality user, it is necessary to provide a unique
disposable code, which assignment is not part of the application
(SafeStreets must take care only of the verification of the provided
code). The code is assigned only to users whose role declaration has
been manually verified by a human operator. For this reason, the
verification of authorities and municipality users is not considered in
the registration phase.

\subsubsection{SafeReports}

SafeReports is the core of the application. It provides common users
with the possibility to send a notification about a violation. To do so,
they are asked to take a picture of the vehicle involved in the
violation. Then the photo is checked and matched with some data captured
at the moment (position, date and time). The user is asked to review and
confirm the violation report that, in case of confirmation, is sent to
SafeStreets, which stores it to offer several other services.

\subsubsection{SafeAnalytics}

SafeAnalytics provides the possibility to mine SafeStreets data to get
information about violations. This service is offered to common users
and authorities, that can access data with different restriction levels.
Common users have access to anonymous data concerning a selected zone.
Authorities, instead, have access to unrestricted information on all the
stored data.

\subsubsection{SafeTickets}

SafeStreets uses Municipality Tickets Service (MTS) to generate traffic
tickets. When a new violation is stored (after it is verified not to be
a duplicated event), the violation report is forwarded to MTS which
generates the traffic tickets and informs SafeStreets of the outcome.
SafeStreets stores data about the issued tickets to provide statistics
through SafeTickets service.\\
SafeTickets is a service that allows authorities to access data about
tickets generated from SafeStreets using MTS. Authorities are also
allowed to select some filters to get statistics and aggregated data.

\subsubsection{SafeSuggestions}

Municipality data about accidents is crossed with data collected by
SafeStreets to identify possible unsafe areas and provide suggestions
through SafeSuggestions service. SafeStreets periodically checks for new
data to collect it and keep suggestions up to date.\\
SafeSuggestions service is developed to municipality users. It allows
them to access suggestions on how to reduce the accidents and violations
rate in the most critical zones. Users can ask for suggestions using
specific filters, depending on their intention to attend in a specific
zone or to prevent a specific violation.
