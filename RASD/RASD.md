## INTRODUCTION

### Purpose 
<!--here we include the goals of the project-->

* **G1**	SafeStreets must allow users to send pictures of violations, including their date, time and position. <!--TODO specify "send"-->

* **G2**	Users must be allowed to access to anonymous and aggregated data.
* **G3**	Authorities must be allowed to access to all the data without restrictions.
* **G4**	When available, data provided from municipality must be integrated into SafeStreets.
* **G5**	SafeStreets must suggest possible interventions according to data that have been collected.
* **G6**	SafeStreets must be able to generate traffic tickets using MTS.
* **G7**	Data provided to generate traffic tickets must be checked to guarantee their reliability.
* **G8**	SafeStreets must provide statistics on issued tickets.

### Scope
<!--here we include an analysis of the world and of the shared phenomena-->

### Document Structure

**Section 1** is an overall introduction to the application. It includes the description of the main functionalities of the application, an analysis of scenarios in which the application works, the list of the potential users of the application with a concise description of the possible interactions and the definition of world-level goals. Also, some meta-informations are included, like revision history, references, and explanation of the conventions occurring in the document.

**Section 2** includes the domain assumptions, a detailed description of the shared phenomena and a formal description of the domain carried out using UML class and state diagrams. The purpose of this section is to exhaustively describe the entities and the scenarios that the application must interact with, to be able, in the following sections, to focus only on the application requirements.

**Section 3** includes a detailed description of the application, useful for the development team. Here are classified the interfaces offered by the application, followed by requirements and constraints. More specifically, requirements are listed and matched with the domain assumptions to show how every goal is attained. In this section, the behavior of the application is described with the highest detail level through the use of sequence, activity, and use case diagrams.

**Section 4** includes the formal analysis carried out using Alloy as a modeling language. This section includes the model built focusing on the most critical aspects and the results of the analysis that proves the soundness and consistency of the model. Moreover, some worlds obtained by running the analysis are included to study in deep the most meaningful assertions.

**Section 5** includes information about the number of hours each group member has worked for this document.

## FORMAL ANALYSIS USING ALLOY
<!--this section should include a brief presentation of the main objectives driving the formal modeling activity, as well as a description of the model itself, what can be proved with it, and why what is proved is important given the problem at hand. To show the soundness and correctness of the model, this section can show some worlds obtained by running it, and/or the results of the checks performed on meaningful assertions-->
