\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

The following mockups are made to give an idea of how the user
interfaces should look like after the developing process. The mockups
represent the core services of SafeStreets focusing on the interaction
between the users and the system.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Scenarios}

\paragraph{Scenario 1}
Ted Mosby, a very honest architect, is tired of seeing cars parked in
the red zone right in front of his house. He told the problem to some
police agents in the past but nothing happened. He wants to report these
violations again but he doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately, Barney,
a public employee, suggests him to download and use the new SafeStreets
application for reporting violations. After signing up identifying
himself as a common user and inserting the email and password he can
finally report the violation. Mosby just needs to activate the GPS and
the internet connection and take a picture of the violation. He selects
the type of violation from a predefined list. After that, he is asked to
confirm the plate of the violating vehicle. He finally waits for the
outcome of his violation report.

\paragraph{Scenario 2}
Sheldon, a theoretical physicist, is currently studying the complexity
theory. He thinks that in big cities with a huge amount of traffic the
number of traffic violations is much larger than in small cities and
villages. Since Sheldon moved to Milan recently, he wants to know the
areas of Milan with the highest levels of traffic violations to avoid
parking in dangerous places. Sheldon knows about the SafeStreets app. He
logs in inserting his email and password and makes a query for all the
traffic violations reported in the last month in Milan. The results are
anonymized preserving the privacy of the violators and then sent back to
Sheldon. Sheldon can now park in safe areas.

\paragraph{Scenario 3}
Chuck, a policeman, was notified about a stolen car. He gets the idea of
looking for its possible traffic violations, to find it. He uses
SafeAnalytics to retrieve information about it, searching for its
license plate. Chuck discovers that the car is often parked on certain
reserved parking and finds the car in that location.

\paragraph{Scenario 4}
Seamus, the police chief, needs to collect the more money he can from
traffic tickets, to fund the construction of another police station.
Thanks to SafeTickets, he can identify the areas in which more traffic
tickets are generated and focus on those areas.

\paragraph{Scenario 5}
Giovanni, a municipality officer of the city of Milan, is looking for
possible interventions in the city, to improve the mobility of his area.
Giovanni logs in SafeStreets and accesses SafeSuggestions. He is
suggested to build a barrier near the sidewalk in Via Golgi, due to the
frequent parking violations that occur there.

\item
  \textbf{R3} When a new violation record is generated, the timestamp is
  added to the report.
\item
  \textbf{R4} When a new violation record is generated, the photo is
  scanned by an OCR software to automatically detect the plate.
\item
  \textbf{R5} If the OCR software fails in detecting the plate, the user
  is notified and asked to repeat the procedure.
\item
  \textbf{R6} If the OCR software detects the plate, the user is asked
  to confirm the violation report.
\item
  \textbf{R7} If the user confirms the violation report, it is sent to
  SafeStreets.
\item
  \textbf{R8} SafeStreets stores the information about the violation
  only if there aren't equivalent events already stored.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{G2) SafeAnalytics must allow common users to get anonymous data
on violations.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{R9} SafeAnalytics allows common users to get data about
  violations selecting zone, time and type of violation.
\item
  \textbf{R10} SafeAnalytics anonymizes information before sending it to
  common users.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{G3) SafeAnalytics must allow authorities to access to all the
data without restrictions.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{R11} SafeAnalytics allows authorities to get all the information
  stored by SafeStreets.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{G4) SafeSuggestions must allow municipality users to get
suggestions on possible interventions.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{R12} SafeStreets must store data about accidents provided by
  the municipality when available.
\item
  \textbf{R13} SafeStreets must analyze collected data crossed with data
  from the municipality to identify possible interventions.
\item
  \textbf{R14} SafeSuggestions allows municipality users to get
  suggestions provided by SafeStreets.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{G5) SafeStreets must generate traffic tickets forwarding
reliable data to MTS.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{R15} When the users send a violation report, its integrity is
  checked.
\item
  \textbf{R16} If the integrity check is not successful, the violation
  report is discarded.
\item
  \textbf{R17} SafeStreets must forward every new stored violation
  report to MTS to generate traffic tickets.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{G6) SafeTickets must allow authorities to get statistics on
issued tickets.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{R18} When a new ticket is generated using MTS, ticket-related
  data are stored by SafeStreets.
\item
  \textbf{R19} SafeStreets must build statistics from stored data about
  issued tickets.
\item
  \textbf{R20} SafeTickets allows authorities to get information and
  statistics on issued tickets.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The system must be able to serve a great number of users reporting a
  violation simultaneously.
\item
  SafeAnalytics must be able to provide the data requested by both
  common users and authorities in less than 3 seconds, to provide the
  best experience.
\item
  The data about accidents provided by the municipality must be checked
  for updates at least every 5 minutes, to provide reliable and always
  updated suggestions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Standards compliance}

The timestamp must adopt the ISO 8601 standard. The chain of custody of
the information coming from the user must never be broken, so the
correspondence of the data provided by a common user and the one
received by MTS must be guaranteed.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}

To correctly run the application, the device must have a camera with a
resolution sufficient to provide an understandable image, a working
internet connection, and a GPS.

\subsubsection{Any other constraint}

The system must not provide sensitive data to common users, so the
license plate and the photo of a violation must not be provided to them.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability}

SafeStreets must be fault-tolerant, so data must not be lost. This can
be achieved by keeping multiple copies of the data.

\subsubsection{Availability}

SafeStreets must be working 24/7.\\
SafeReports is expected to work with an availability of 99.999\%, as it
is the core of the application. The other functionalities can be
slightly less fault-tolerant, and be available 99.99\% of the time.

\subsubsection{Security}

The data provided by common users contain sensitive information, so
security is a crucial point. The databases on which data is collected
must be protected to avoid attacks, and the software must be GDPR
compliant. Data must be encrypted when sent, and the reliability of the
data received by MTS must be checked.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

The code must be easy to fix and modify, to reduce the effort and the
cost of the modifications. It must avoid fast obsolescence, so be always
as aligned as possible to the new stable technologies.\\
The modularity of the code and the reusability of the logic (which needs
to be as separated as possible from the implementation) are needed to
guarantee the ease of maintenance in the future.

\subsubsection{Portability}

The software is thought to run on the majority of mobile devices, so it
should be developed for Android and iOS smartphones.
